The non-linear terms appearing in the right-hand side of the primitive equations are averaged along the trajectory using their interpolation at the trajectory mid- and departure points. The scheme uses 32-point quasi-cubic interpolations (linear interpolation along the edges of the stencil, fully cubic in the interior \u2013 see Ritchie et al., 1995). Interpolation are also quasi-monotone for all model advected variables (Bermejo & Staniforth, 1992), except the vertical interpolations involved in the momentum and thermodynamic equations. The semi-Lagrangian dynamical core is not fully conservative (e.g., Lucarini & Ragone, 2011). A local mass fixer algorithm based on Bermejo and Conde (2002) is applied to specific humidity and microphysical species (Diamantakis & Flemming, 2014). A global and uniform conservation procedure for the model atmosphere dry mass (additive correction on the surface pressure) and total water content (multiplicative correction on the surface precipitation flux) is also applied every time step.

The RRTM scheme follows the two-stream approach and computes upward and downward radiative fluxes in 16 spectral bands encompassing the 10-3000 cm-1 range. The parameterization uses the correlated-k approach with 140 g-points (the number per spectral band depends on the absorption coefficient variations within this band and on the spectral band contribution to the total flux). It includes line absorption by H2O, CO2 , O3 , CH4 , N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 based on the HITRAN 1996 spectrocospic data base (Rothman et al., 1998) and on the CKD 2.2 water vapor continuum model (Clough et al. 1989). The shortwave radiation scheme, originally developed by Fouquart and Bonnel (1980) and which further evolved in the IFS system until its cycle 32r2 (Morcrette et al., 2008), integrates the fluxes over the whole shortwave spectrum between 200 and 4000 nm. The scheme includes Rayleigh scattering, absorption by water vapor and ozone, both varying in space and time, and by CO2, N2O, CO, CH4 and O2, which are treated as uniformly mixed gases. The parameterization resolved the radiative transfer equations in 6 spectral bands, three bands being in the UV and visible spectral range (185-250, 250-440 and 440-690 nm) and three bands covering the near infrared range (690-1190, 1190-2380 and 2380-4000 nm)."

It is based on the NOCS-ORCA1 configuration described in details in Danabasoglu et al. (2014). Main differences are highlighted below.\n\tNEMOv3.6 is run on eORCA1 horizontal grid, which is an extension of the ORCA1\u00b0 tripolar grid already used in CNRM-CM5.1. The eORCA family differs from the ORCA family by the use of two quasi-isotropic bipolar grids south of 67\u00b0S instead of the former Mercator grid, which allows for a more realistic representation of the contours of Antarctic ice shelves (Mathiot et al., 2017). In eORCA1, a nominal resolution of 1\u00b0 is chosen to which a latitudinal grid refinement of 1/3\u00b0 is added in the tropics.\n\tNEMOv3.6 resolves ocean dynamics on 75 vertical levels using a vertical z-coordinate with partial step bathymetry formulation (Barnier et al., 2006). The level thickness increases from 1m near the surface to 200 m at a depth of 6000 m. The time step is 30 minutes. At the surface, the model uses the split-explicit non-linear free surface formulation proposed by Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005), with a variable volume. Seawater thermodynamics uses the equation of state defined in the Thermodynamic Equation of State 2010 (TEOS-10, IOC et al., 2010), with conservative temperature and absolute salinity being then the prognostic variables. \n\tRadiative transfer in the water column is resolved using a chlorophyll-dependent three-waveband scheme as described in Lengaigne et al. (2007) and Mignot et al. (2013), using a seasonal climatology of surface chlorophyll concentration derived from a former 60-year long simulation run with NEMO-PISCES (e.g. Lee et al., 2016). A vertical profile of chlorophyll concentration is extrapolated from surface concentrations.\n\tLateral diffusivity and viscosity are parameterized as in NOCS-ORCA1 (Danabasoglu et al., 2014). Parameterization of vertical mixing is also similar, with two notable exceptions in CNRM-CM6-1: mixing induced by breaking internal waves is parameterized following de Lavergne et al. (2016) and the Fox-Kemper et al. (2011)  submesoscale mixed layer restratification scheme is activated."

Aerosols are included through sectional bins, separating desert dust (3 size bins), sea-salt (3 size bins), sulphate (1 bin, as well as 1 additional variable for sulfate precursors considered as SO2), organic matter (2 bins: hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles) and black carbon (2 bins:  hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles) particles. All these 12 species are prognostic variables in the model, submitted to transport (semi-lagrangian advection, and convective transport), dry deposition, in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging. The interaction with shortwave and longwave radiation, is also taken into account through optical properties (extinction coefficient, single scattering albedo and asymmetry parameter) calculated using the Mie theory. Sulfate, organic matter and sea salt concentrations are used to determine the cloud droplet number concentration following Menon et al.

(2018)). It is an \u201con-line\u201d scheme whereby the chemistry routines are part of the physics of the atmospheric climate model and called at each time-step of the physics. The scheme does not represent the low troposphere ozone non-methane hydrocarbon chemistry and considers 63 chemistry species that are prognostic variables of the climate model. Chemical evolution is computed down to the 560 hPa level (for details see Michou et al. (2011) and Morgenstern et al. (2017)). Below this level, the concentration of a number of species are relaxed towards the yearly evolving global mean abundances of CMIP6 (Meinshausen et al. (2017)); for the other species concentrations below 560 hPa level are relaxed towards the 560 hPa value. Coherently with the relaxation, explicit emissions, dry deposition, wash-out and parameterised transport (diffusion and convection) of the chemical fields are not considered. The 3-D concentrations of H2O, CO2 , O3 , CH4 , N2O, CFC11, and CFC12 are transferred to the radiative code."

It uses the concept of mesophyll conductance defined in this framework as the rate of photosynthesis under light-saturated conditions (Jacobs et al., 1994). As such, this scheme does not explicitly account for the Michealis-Menten kinetics of the Rubisco enzyme formalized by Farquhar et al. (1980) and Collatz et al. (1992). Goudriaan\u2019s approach was originally chosen by Calvet et al (1998) because it uses conductances instead of enzyme kinetics and was at the time more easily coupled to the existing land surface model. Carbon assimilation is calculated from air CO2 concentration, leaf temperature, solar radiation considering C3 or C4 photosynthetic pathways (Calvet et al., 1998; Gibelin et al., 2006) and the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2, Ci/Ca.  This ratio is affected by the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit from a maximum value at zero deficit to a minimum value for which stomatal closure happens. The maximum value of Ci/Ca is a major parameter of the model. Stomatal conductance is finally deduced from the assimilation rate taking into account cuticular conductance and diffusion competition between H2O and CO2 within the stomatal opening.  No Nitrogen dependency except for an ad-hoc down-regulartion: gross photosynthesis is multiplied by a factor equal to 1 at preindustrial concentration (below CO2ref = 288ppmv) and decreasing with increasing CO2 concentration."

Vegetation is represented by 6 biomass pools. Leaf phenology results directly from the carbon balance of the leaves. Leaf area index (LAI) is diagnosed from leaf biomass and specific leaf area index. Wild fires are represented and land-cover changes are resolved following CMIP6 standard. Vegetation distribution is fixed. The vegetation responds to environmental variations by accounting for both CO2 effect on stomatal closure and the CO2 fertilization on vegetation biomass.. The litter and soil organic matter module includes 4 litter carbon pools and 3 soil carbon pools and represents leaching of carbon. Vegetation roughness length and snow-free land surface albedo (Carrer et al. 2014) are specified according to the ECOCLIMAP database (Faroux et al. 2013) while the soil textural properties come from the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO 2012), both at a 1 km resolution.

An explicit two-way coupling between ISBA and CTRIP has been set up via the introduction of a standardized coupling interface in SURFEX (Voldoire et al. 2017) with the OASIS3-MCT coupler. This coupling allows to account for, first, a dynamic river flooding scheme in which floodplains interact with the soil and the atmosphere through free-water evaporation, infiltration and precipitation interception and second, a two-dimensional diffusive groundwater scheme to represent unconfined aquifers and upward capillarity fluxes into the superficial soil. CTRIP also transports the soil carbon leaching from ISBA to the ocean."

It is based on the NOCS-ORCA1 configuration described in details in Danabasoglu et al. (2014). Main differences are highlighted below.\n\tNEMOv3.6 is run on eORCA1 horizontal grid, which is an extension of the ORCA1\u00b0 tripolar grid already used in CNRM-CM5.1. The eORCA family differs from the ORCA family by the use of two quasi-isotropic bipolar grids south of 67\u00b0S instead of the former Mercator grid, which allows for a more realistic representation of the contours of Antarctic ice shelves (Mathiot et al., 2017). In eORCA1, a nominal resolution of 1\u00b0 is chosen to which a latitudinal grid refinement of 1/3\u00b0 is added in the tropics.\n\tNEMOv3.6 resolves ocean dynamics on 75 vertical levels using a vertical z-coordinate with partial step bathymetry formulation (Barnier et al., 2006). The level thickness increases from 1m near the surface to 200 m at a depth of 6000 m. The time step is 30 minutes. At the surface, the model uses the split-explicit non-linear free surface formulation proposed by Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005), with a variable volume. Seawater thermodynamics uses the equation of state defined in the Thermodynamic Equation of State 2010 (TEOS-10, IOC et al., 2010), with conservative temperature and absolute salinity being then the prognostic variables. \n\tRadiative transfer in the water column is resolved using a chlorophyll-dependent three-waveband scheme as described in Lengaigne et al. (2007) and S\u00e9f\u00e9rian et al. (2019).\n\tLateral diffusivity and viscosity are parameterized as in NOCS-ORCA1 (Danabasoglu et al., 2014). Parameterization of vertical mixing is also similar, with two notable exceptions in CNRM-CM6-1: mixing induced by breaking internal waves is parameterized following de Lavergne et al. (2016) and the Fox-Kemper et al. (2011)  submesoscale mixed layer restratification scheme is activated."

The extinction depths of the red, green and blue wavelengths are computed interactively from the chlorophyll concentration using the formulation proposed in Morel and Maritorena (2001).\nIn CNRM-ESM2-1, the chlorophyll concentrations are taken at each time-step from the marine biogeochemical model PISCESv2-gas."

            "Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies model volume 2 version trace gases (PISCESv2-gas) derives from PISCESv2 as described in Aumont et al. (2015). PISCESv2-gas simulates the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and of the major nutrients determining phytoplankton growth (phosphate, nitrate, ammonium, iron and silicic acid). PISCESv2-gas also simulates dimethylsulfide (DMS) and nitrous oxide (N2O) tracers (see Berthet et al. 2019). The carbon chemistry of the model is based on the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) protocol and the parametrization proposed by Wanninkhof (2014) is used to compute air-sea gas exchange of CO2, O2, DMS and N2O. PISCES includes a simple representation of the marine ecosystem with two phytoplankton size classes, representing nanophytoplankton and diatoms, as well as two zooplankton size classes, representing microzooplankton and mesozooplankton. Phytoplankton growth is limited by the availability of nutrients, temperature, and light. There are three non-living components of organic carbon in the model: semi-labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with a lifetime of several weeks to years, as well as large and small detrital particles, which are fuelled by mortality, aggregation, fecal pellet production and grazing. Biogenic silica and calcite particles are also included\nNutrients and/or carbon are supplied to the ocean from three different sources: atmospheric deposition, rivers and sediment mobilization. These sources are explicitly included and vary in time apart the iron input of sediment. Atmospheric deposition of Fe, P and Si has been estimated from the INCA model and the one of N is coming from the Input4MIPS database.  Riverine inputs are interactive in CNRM-ESM2-1 because the litter and soil carbon leaching in SURFEXv8.0 (see Section 2.4 for further details), is routed as dissolved organic carbon in CTRIP and supplied to the oceans as organic carbon by rivers in PISCESv2-gas. Since only the routing of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is bounded in CNRM-ESM2-1, the supply of the other nutrients has been parameterized using the global average ratios of nitrogen-to-DOC (0.72), phosphorus-to-DOC (0.59), silicon-to-DOC (0.15) from Mayorga et al. (2010) and the global average ratios of DIC-to-DOC (1.48) and Alk-to-DOC (1.11) from Ludwig et al. (1996).River discharge of carbon and nutrients is taken from GlobalNews in NEMO standalone mode. Iron input from sediment mobilization has been parameterized as in Aumont et al. (2015). \nNutrients and/or carbon are supplied to the ocean from three different sources: atmospheric deposition, rivers and sediment mobilization. These sources are explicitly included but do not vary in time apart from a climatological seasonal cycle for the atmospheric input. Atmospheric deposition (Fe, N, P and Si) has been estimated from the INCA model (Aumont et al, 2008). River discharge of carbon and nutrients is taken from Ludwig et al (1996). Iron input from sediment mobilization has been parameterized as in Aumont and Bopp (2006).\nPISCES is used here not only to compute air-sea fluxes of carbon, but also to compute the effect of a biophysical coupling: the chlorophyll concentration produced by the biological component retroacts on the ocean heat budget by modulating the absorption of light as well as the oceanic heating rate (see Lengaigne et al (2007) for a detailed description)."

The model also includes a fixed monthly climatology of mass-mixing ratios of secondary organic aerosols from terpene emissions (biogenic aerosols). All aerosol species, except sea-salt and biogenic aerosols, are advected using the tracer advection scheme and undergo wet and dry deposition. Wet deposition accounts for re-evaporation of precipitation (Bellouin et al., 2007). All aerosol species exert a direct effect (scattering and absorption of shortwave and longwave radiation) and thereby also a semi-direct effect (impact on atmospheric temperature and cloud profiles of aerosol absorption). All aerosol species, except black carbon and mineral dust, also contribute to both the first and second indirect effects on clouds, modifying cloud albedo and precipitation efficiency, respectively. The version of the sulphur cycle is described in Jones et al. [2001] and Roberts and Jones [2004] with further improvements described hereafter. The sulphate scheme is a modal scheme where the free aerosol is assumed to have a log-normal size distribution in the Aitken and accumulation size ranges, which include particles with a radius less than 0.05 and 0.5 m, respectively. Sulphate aerosol may also be in a dissolved mode where layer clouds are present, thus affecting the cloud droplet size and exerting first and second indirect effects (modification of cloud albedo and precipitation efficiency, respectively). The sulphur cycle also includes improvements described by Bellouin et al. [2007]: condensation of sulphuric acid from dry oxidation of sulphur dioxide and dimethysulphide, and conversion from Aitken to accumulation mode particles by condensation. In addition, the oxidation of SO2 and DMS is now using oxidant concentrations (OH, HO2, H2O2, O3) provided by ancillary files. Emissions of dimethylsulphide from the ocean are calculated from the concentration of DMS in seawater (provided by an ancillary file), surface windspeed and sea-surface temperature. The sea salt scheme is a simple diagnostic scheme depending on wind speed and height above the surface to determine the number concentration of sea salt particles in two size modes (Jones et al., 2001). Schemes for black carbon from fossil-fuel emissions (Roberts and Jones, 2004), biomass-burning, and organic carbon from fossil-fuel emissions (Collins et al, 2008) include modes for freshly emitted particles that gradually age into another, more hygroscopic mode; there is also a mode for aerosols that have become incorporated into cloud droplets. Black carbon is considered to be slightly hygroscopic, only becoming incorporated into cloud droplets by diffusion, whereas organic carbon and biomass-burning aerosols are considered to act as cloud condensation nuclei. The mineral dust scheme is based on Woodward (2001) with revisions described by Bellouin et al. (2007).  Emissions are computed interactively and depend on vegetation fraction, soil roughness length and moisture, and near surface wind speeds. The modelled horizontal flux is calculated for nine size bins covering particle radii from  0.0316 to 1000 microns.  The vertical flux into the atmosphere is obtained from the horizontal flux and partitioned across six size bins, covering radii from 0.0316 to 31.6 microns. These six size bins are then transported and experience deposition through gravitational settling, turbulent mixing, and below cloud scavenging."

Gaseous absorption is based on the updated High-Resolution Transmission (HITRAN) 2000 database (Rothman et al., 2003). The water vapour continuum is version 2.4 of the Clough-Kneizys-Davies (CKD) formulation (Clough et al., 1992) and has been included in the shortwave region. Treatment of the effects of non-spherical ice cloud particles are determined using the parameterization by Kristjansson et al. (2000).

For sulphur dioxide, anthropogenic emissions are split into surface and chimney-level emissions. Natural emissions from volcanoes are provided as a 3D field. DMS emissions are provided by the ocean biogeochemistry scheme over the ocean, and provided through a dataset over land surfaces. All sulphur-cycle emissions are expressed in term of mass of sulphur within the model. For black-carbon and organic-carbon aerosols from fossil-fuel and biofuel emissions, emissions are provided at near-surface level. These emissions are expressed in term of mass of carbon. For biomass-burning aerosol, emissions are provided as two fields: surface emissions, and high-level emissions. The latter field is homogeneously distributed across the boundary layer. Biomass emissions are expressed in term of mass of carbon. Emissions for sea-salt and mineral dust aerosols are computed interactively from the modelled meteorology and soil properties by their respective schemes. The climatology of monthly-averaged mass-mixing ratios of secondary organic aerosol from terpene emissions was derived from the chemistry-transport model STOCHEM (Derwent et al., 2003). 2D emissions: All emission fields are provided as monthly means, which are time interpolated by the model every 5 days. Sulphur dioxide emissions are derived from sector-based emissions datasets for IPCC AR5 (Lamarque et al., 2009). Emissions for all sectors are considered surface emissions, except for energy emissions and half of industrial emissions which are considered chimney-level emissions. Emissions for land-based dimethylsulphide are taken from Spiro et al. (1992). Anthropogenic emissions for black carbon and organic carbon are from the sum of all sector-based emissions in the IPCC AR5 dataset. They are emitted in the second level of the model (near-surface emissions). Anthropogenic emissions for biomass-burning aerosol are the sum of IPCC AR5 emissions for black and organic carbon from biomass-burning emissions. Grass fire emissions are assumed to be surface emissions, while forest fire emissions are distributed homogeneously across the boundary layer. Emissions based on interactive schemes: Sea-salt and mineral dust aerosol emissions are computed interactively depending on modelled near-surface wind speeds and soil properties (Jones et al., 2001; Woodward, 2001). The only 3D aerosol-related emissions used in the model are natural emissions of sulphur dioxide from background volcanoes (Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998). Aircraft emissions of aerosol precursors or primary [aerosols] are not included in the model."

HadGEM2-ES includes interactive modelling of atmospheric aerosols, driven by surface and elevated emissions and including tropospheric chemical processes as well as physical removal processes such as washout. The aerosol species represented in the model are sulphate, black carbon, biomass smoke, sea salt, organic carbon, mineral dust and a biogenic climatology. The atmospheric component has a horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees of latitude by 1.875 degrees of longitude with 38 layers in the vertical extending to over 39 km in height. The model uses the Arakawa C-grid horizontally and the Charney-Phillips grid vertically. The atmospheric timestep period is 30 minutes (48 timesteps per day)."

In this model, photosynthesis, net of photorespiration, is the smaller of an electron-transport-limited and a carboxylation-limited rate (Collatz-et-al-1991), and is affected by incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, intercellular [CO2] and carboxylation capacity, Vmax. The latter is determined prognostically based on the assumption (Haxeltine-and-Prentice-1996a) that plants allocate N (for investment in the enzyme rubisco that determines Vmax) throughout the canopy in a manner that maximises net CO2 assimilation at the canopy level."

            "The N cycle in LPJ-GUESS is well described in Smith-et-al-2014.\n\nN enters the ecosystem via N deposition (single bulk value encompassing wet and dry deposition) and biological N fixation (BNF, kg N ha\u22121 yr\u22121). N deposition is prescribed as monthly mean values from an external database, whereas BNF is computed prognostically based on an empirical dependency on ecosystem ET from Cleveland-et-al-1999. Among three alternatives proposed by Cleveland-et-al-1999 LPJ-GUESS chose the lower-range \u201cconservative\u201d parameterisation, with 5-year average actual evapotranspiration (AET, mm yr\u22121), prognosed by the model, as the independent variable\n\nBNF = 0.0102 \u00b7 AET + 0.524\n\nBNF is distributed equally throughout the year and added directly to the soil-available mineral N pool, Navail, which is capped at a saturation level of 2 g N m\u22122 following Parton-et-al-1993. BNF in excess of the saturation level is discarded (assumed not to have occurred). N deposition during periods of snow lie is stored in the snowpack and released to the soil in proportion to snowmelt.\n\nN is lost from the ecosystem via leaching, computed daily as the sum of leached soluble organic N and leached mineral N, and through volatilisation by wildfires. In addition, 1 % of daily N mineralisation is assumed to be lost as gaseous emissions from soils. Leaching of soluble organic N and C is computed conjointly as a fraction (LO) of the soil microbial SOM N and C pool, dependent on percolation (PH2O, mm) and soil sand fraction (TS), following  Parton-et-al-1993\n\nLO = 1.83 \u00b7 10\u22124 \u00b7 PH2O(0.01 + 0.04 \u00b7 TS).\n\nFor mineral N, the leaching fraction (LM) depends on daily percolation as a fraction of available soil water content (WTOT, mm)\n\nLM = PH2O / WTOT\n\nC and N dynamics of soils are simulated conjointly by an SOM scheme adopted from the CENTURY model (Parton-et-al-1993), with modifications by Comins-and-McMurtrie-1993 and Kirschbaum-and-Paul-2002, and updates by Parton-et-al-2010. Eleven pools differing in C:N stoichiometry and base decay rate are distinguished. Decomposition, computed daily for each pool, results in heterotrophic respiration (release of CO2) and transfer of C and N between pools, satisfying mass balance. Carbon entering the receiver pool drives N mineralisation or immobilisation. N is mineralised (added to the soil mineral N pool, Navail) when N transferred from a donor pool exceeds the corresponding increase dictated by the prescribed C:N ratio of a receiver pool (N \u201csupply\u201c exceeds \u201cdemand\u201c). Conversely, if the N flux from a donor pool is too small to satisfy the C:N ratio of the receiver pool (demand > supply), N immobilisation occurs, reducing Navail to satisfy the deficit. If Navail is insufficient to satisfy the N demand for immobilisation among all pools, decay rates are reduced proportionately so that net immobilisation matches Navail.\n\nPlants obtain N for allocation to their biomass compartments leaves, fine roots and (for woody PFTs) sapwood through root uptake from the soil mineral N pool Navail. N uptake takes place daily and is the smaller of current supply, i.e. Navail, and demand, subject to a maximum constraint on total uptake. Vegetation N demand is based on a solution of the carboxylation capacity of rubisco (Vmax) that maximises net assimilation at the canopy level given current temperature, light interception and intercellular [CO2], the latter affected by ambient [CO2] but also by the influence of soil moisture and boundary layer humidity on stomatal conductance (Haxeltine-and-Prentice-1996a, Haxeltine-and-Prentice-b; Sitch-et-al-2003). Following Haxeltine-and-Prentice-1996a, leaf N content (Nleaf, g N m\u22122) is related to Vmax (g C m\u22122) by the relationship\n\nNleaf = 2083 \u00b7 Vmax \u00b7 exp[\u22120.693 \u00b7 (T \u221225)] / L \u00b7 f(LAI) + 7.15 \u00b7 Cleaf\n\nwhere T is air temperature (\u25e6C); L is day length (s); Cleaf is leaf C mass, accounting for canopy phenology (g C m\u22122); and f(LAI) is a modifier dependent on current leaf area index (LAI, m2 m\u22122) that accounts for the empirical finding that leaf N content declines more gradually with canopy depth compared to incoming sunlight (Lloyd-et-al-2010; Peltoniemi-et-al-2012)\n\nf(LAI) = exp(0.12 \u00b7 LAI)\n\nBased on the Nleaf eqn, the target leaf C:N mass ratio may be calculated as Cleaf / Nleaf. Leaf C:N is, however, constrained to remain within prescribed boundaries [CNleaf,min, CNleaf,max] based on observations (Reich-et-al-1992; White-et-al-2000). C:N ratios for the further compartments\u2019 fine roots and (for woody PFTs) sapwood are assumed to vary proportionately with leaf C:N, fine roots maintaining a C:N ratio 1.16 times higher, and sapwood 6.9 times higher, than leaves (Friend-et-al-1997)."

            "After deduction of 10 % for reproductive costs, plants invest their annual NPP in biomass growth. For woody PFTs, relative allocation to the biomass compartments leaves, fine roots and sapwood is determined at the level of the average individual of a cohort in a patch by satisfying mechanical, functional balance and demographic constraints. Stem diameter increases with height\n\nH = k2 \u00b7 D^(2/3)\n\nwhere H is stem height (m), D is stem diameter (m) and k2 is a PFT-specific constant. Sapwood \u2013 which contains the transport vessels that supply leaves with water and the whole plant with assimilates of photosynthesis \u2013 is\nassumed to maintain a cross-sectional area in proportion to the total area of leaves\n\nLA = k_(LA:SA) \u00b7 SA\n\nwhere LA is annual maximum individual leaf area (m2), SA is sapwood cross-sectional area (m2) and k_(LA:SA) is a PFT specific constant. Relative investment in aboveand below-ground resource-uptake surfaces \u2013 leaves and fine roots \u2013 is affected by resource stress experienced the preceding growing season\n\nCleaf = lrmax \u00b7 \u03c9 \u00b7 Croot\n\nwhere Cleaf and Croot denote the annual maximum C biomass of leaves and fine roots, respectively (kg C m\u22122); lrmax is a PFT-specific constant; and \u03c9 is a dimensionless scalar in the range 0\u20131, lower values being indicative of stress experienced either as a reduction in photosynthesis below potential due to stomatal closure under soil water limitation or leaf N limitation on the carboxylation capacity of rubisco. As individuals within a cohort grow in size and canopy spread, crowding increases competition among individuals for limited above- and below-ground resources, resulting in suppression and ultimately mortality of a proportion of individuals. This phenomenon, known as selfthinning, results in a negative relationship between size and density in closed forest stands, and provides a fourth allometric constraint, linking crown area (the inverse of density assuming perfect space-filling by tree crowns) to stem diameter\n\nCA = k1 \u00b7 D^1.6\n\nwhere CA is crown area (m2) and k1 is a PFT-specific constant. Allocation for herbaceous PFTs, which lack stems in the model, is subject only to the functional balance constraint. A functional trade-off between leaf quality and short-term carbon return is represented as a fixed dependency of specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per unit C mass, m2 kg C\u22121) on leaf longevity, based on a well-documented global relationship between these variables. Longer-lived leaves carry a larger cost in terms of allocated C per unit leaf area, but provide a more-than-equal return in terms of assimilated C if temperatures and soil conditions are conducive to achieving positive C balance for a sufficiently long growing season each year. PFTs have prescribed turnover coefficients (yr\u22121) for leaves, fine roots and (for woody PFTs) sapwood. Shed leaves and fine roots become part of the above-ground and soil litter pools where they enter the soil decomposition cycle. Sapwood is converted to non-living heartwood, which contributes to stem dimensions but is no longer involved in water and solute transport, and does not respire (Smith-et-al-2014). \n "

Vegetation is represented as a mixture of plant functional types (PFTs) that represent the globally most abundant growth strategies of woody and herbaceous vegetation. PFTs are distinguished in terms of growth form, phenology, life history strategy, allometry, photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4), climate-dependent scaling of physiological processes and a limited set of bioclimatic limits (Smith et al., 2014). The model uses climate, [CO2], soil information and nitrogen deposition as input, and plant communities evolve dynamically from growth and competition for light, space and soil resources (water and nitrogen) in response to these drivers. LPJ-GUESS also includes a detailed representation of land-use change dynamics together with a crop module (Lindeskog-et-al-2013). In the crop module for global-scale applications, the dominant crop types, such as wheat, maize and rice are represented as crop PFTs, which differ amongst others in management-related parameters such as baseline sowing and harvest dates. Sowing and harvest decisions are modelled based on climate variability and climatic thresholds (Lindeskog-et-al-2013). Irrigation, residue removal after harvest and cover crops between the main growing-seasons, are further management options available in the model. Whereas for other managed land-uses (pasture and urban land-use) and peatland two herbaceous species, one each conforming to the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, are simulated. LPJ-GUESS simulate vegetation composition and cover in terms of major PFTs, biomass and soil organic matter carbon pools, leaf area index (LAI), net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem carbon balance, carbon emissions from wildfires, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), evapotranspiration, runoff, nitrogen pools and fluxes, methane emissions, and permafrost."

An explicit phenological cycle is simulated only for leaves and fine roots in seasonal-deciduous and stress-deciduous PFTs, whereas evergreen PFTs have a prescribed background litterfall for leaves, fine roots and sapwood. Seasonal-deciduous plant phenology is based on a PFT-dependent accumulated GDD sum threshold for leaf onset, with leaf area rising from 0 to the pre-determined annual maximum leaf area linearly with an additional 200 (100 for herbaceous and needleleaved tree PFTs) degree days above a threshold of 5C. For seasonal-deciduous PFTs, growing season length is fixed, all leaves being shed after the equivalent of 210 days with full leaf cover. Stress-deciduous plant phenology PFTs shed their leaves whenever the water stress scalar \u03c9 drops below a threshold, \u03c9min, signifying the onset of a drought period or dry season. New leaves are produced, after a prescribed minimum dormancy period, when \u03c9 again rises above \u03c9min (Smith-et-al-2014).

            "Vegetation dynamics in LPJ-GUESS are based on the gap-phase dynamics theory as conceptualised in so-called forest gap models (Bugmann-2001). The implementation in LPJ-GUESS is fully described by Smith-et-al-2001. Multiple PFTs are represented and may co-occur within simulated stands or grid cells. The basic structural unit is an average individual plant, whose state is defined by foliage and fine root compartments, for woody PFTs also sapwood and heartwood. Each compartment consists of a quantity of C biomass expressed on a patch ground area basis, kg C m\u22122. For woody PFTs, each average individual is associated with a cohort (age class) of individuals that are born in the same year and retain the same size and form as they grow. Stem density (indiv. m\u22122) is an additional state descriptor for a cohort in a patch. For herbaceous PFTs (\u201cgrasses\u201d) a single average individual represents the entire population of a given patch; cohorts are not distinguished and population density is not defined. For woody PFTs, height, stem diameter and crown area of individual trees (or shrubs) can be derived from the state variables, i.e. sapwood biomass and stem density, based on PFT-specific allometric constants (see Smith-et-al-2014). Patches (0.1 ha) correspond to the maximum expected area of influence, in terms of competition for light and soil resources, of a large individual tree on its neighbours. Replicate patches are simulated to account for landscape-scale heterogeneity in stand structure and composition arising from the differential disturbance histories of different patches. In a standard simulation, generic patch-destroying disturbances (representing, for example, windstorms or landslides) recur stochastically with a prescribed expected frequency, typically 0.01 yr\u22121. Wildfires are also simulated and result in partial destruction of the biomass of an affected patch. Bioclimatic limits define the environmental envelope within which PFTs are able to establish and/or survive under current climate conditions in a simulated site or grid cell. Establishment is also affected by stand structure, the density of new individuals born each year declining as crowding reduces potential forest-floor NPP below the optimum possible in the absence of standing vegetation, preempting light and soil resources. PFTs differ in terms of a suite of prescribed parameters that together define their life-history strategy. In general, shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant PFTs are distinguished. Shade-intolerant PFTs exhibit relatively dense establishment under initial, non-crowded conditions, rapid height growth, a short average life span, and poor tolerance of resource stress, the lattermost resulting in markedly increased mortality, reducing stem density and biomass, under shading or other resource-deficit-mediated stress. Shade-tolerant PFTs have lower initial establishment and slower height growth but a longer expected life span and lower mortality under shading or resource stress. Interactions between PFTs differing in life history and other characteristics greatly influence the structural and compositional evolution of stands (patches) following a disturbance; under climate conditions promoting sufficient productivity for stand closure, a classic secondary successional series, with shade-intolerant trees displacing an initial layer of grass, to be subsequently succeeded by shade-tolerant trees, typically emerges (Smith-et-al-2014)."

Aerosol activation is computed using a K\u00f6hler-theory based parameterization. For stratiform mixed-phase clouds heterogenous nucleation (immersion and contact freezing) of supercooled cloud droplets is computed. For stratiform cirrus clouds homogeneous nucleation of solution droplets is computed. Size dependent wet scavenging of aerosol particles in-cloud and below cloud is included. The below cloud collection efficiencies as a function of aerosol and rain drop or snow crystal size are read from a look-up table. The in-cloud scavenging scheme takes nucleation scavenging and impaction scavenging of aerosol particles with cloud droplets and ice-crystals into account."

Also the tuning was done to the present-day climate and not to historical trends, except for some late tuning of the indirect aerosol effect.\nThe surface temperature, both on continental surface and ocean were given a particular importance, with a specific work on continental mid-latitude, polar ice sheets, and semi arid tropical region (in particular Sahel). Over ocean tuning was targeting specifically the reduction of the well known \u201cSST warm biases\u201d over the eastern Side of Tropical Ocean and around the Antarctic. Eyes have also kept track of a possible warm bias in the austral ocean, which was prominent in previous versions of the model but happily didn\u2019t appear persistently in IPSL-CM6A-LR.\nMost of the sea ice tuning was done offline, through a long history of forced-atmosphere OMIP-type runs. Ice dynamics were adjusted during that procedure (in particular the ice strength parameter P*) and satisfactory results were easily obtained in such setups. The targets were: the observed seasonal cycle of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extents, and an annual mean Arctic sea ice volume of 20,000 km3. We did not control the Southern Ocean ice volume. The tuning was approximate in that there was no strictly applied criterion, but only a visual verification.\nOnce in coupled mode, it was a bit more complicated to achieve reasonable Arctic sea ice. The atmospheric tuning targeted the observed SST from 50S to 50N, which left positive winter air temperature biases in the Arctic. As a consequence, winter ice would insufficiently grow and summer ice would typically disappear. To compensate for these deficiencies, we increased the surface albedo for all surface types (to reduce melting), giving 0.58 for the diffuse broadband melting bare ice albedo and the thermal conductivity of snow to 0.5 W/m/K (to increase winter growth), up to what we considered their largest acceptable values. That we did not go beyond unphysical boundaries for these parameters left a low summer sea ice extent bias of about 1-2 million sq km2 (depending on ensemble members).\nSimilarly, the North Atlantic Meridional Overtuning Circulation (AMOC) was too weak in the first versions of the model, and having a strong enough Atlantic overturning circulation was also considered as an important target. Unfortunately, summer Arctic sea ice extent and AMOC strength were very strongly tied in the model, with a strengthened AMOC yielding more poleward heat transport and less Arctic sea ice. While this chain of interactions may have physical basis (e.g. Zhang et al., 2017), we had to find ways around it so as to enable a tuning of both of the crucial elements of the climate system.\nThe representation of clouds and of their radiative effect were a dominant target of the tuning as well as the representation of surface meteorology. This part benefited from significant improvements in the model content which helped make the tuning not extreme.\nThe tuning was targeting the present-day climate and not the historical trend. In fact, during all the development phase and tuning of the model, it was suspected that the model ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity) was probably in the upper range, or even maybe outside the range of previously estimated values. However, this was never seen as a metrics for target, conserving thus the idea that ECS should be an emerging property of the model. The amplitude of the historical warming was only somewhat adjusted when it was discovered that the overestimation was probably due for a large part for the cancellation of the aerosol indirect radiative effect after changes in the cloud tuning. Only this amplitude of the aerosol radiative forcing (in terms of present-day/preindustrial contrast) was adjusted but not \u201cgiving too much importance\u201d to the agreement between the simulated and observed XXth century.\nIn order to make full use of observations of the last decade, the adjustment of the coupled model was done on present-day conditions first. For this, the missing oceanic heat uptake, which should normally prevent running equilibrium simulation in present-day conditions, was replaced by an artificial offset of the oceanic albedo by 0.007. The SST between 50N and 50S was favored as a target for this tuning because of the robustness of the observations. However, the compromise was made accepting an underestimation of this averaged SST to allow to a more realistic Arctic sea ice extent. This choice can also be related to the fact that the bias in SST is generally more positive in the 50N-50S band than on the full globe. Once this present-day tuning accomplished, the simulation is then continued with preindustrial conditions removing the surface albedo offset."

No choice in the cloud or convective schemes were guided by a particular target on the ECS nor by a matching of the historical temperature trends.\nHowever, looking at simulations with an extreme warming in the temperature evolution over the XXth century, it was realized that, because of changes in the tuning of the cloud model, the aerosol indirect effect (difference between present day and preindustrial period) was null. The relationship used to relate the aerosol climatology to the condensation nuclei concentration was thus readjusted which helped reduce the discrepancy with trend observations.

Because of the model climate sensitivity, there is about a 1K to 1W/m2 relationship between a modification of the top-of-atmosphere global radiative budget in the forced by SST stand alone atmospheric model and a modification of the global mean temperature in coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations.\nBecause probably of errors in the relationship between TOA and surface fluxes, or because of biases in coupled SSTs that can change the TOA unbalance, there is an offset between the radiative balance at present-day with forced SSTs (~2.4 W/m2) and the top-of-atmosphere budget in the coupled model for present-day conditions (~0.7 W/m2).\nEnergy conservation is not fully conserved by the model. It is not properly conserved in particular for water phase changes in the atmospheric models.\nBut the offset between the global balance in coupled and stand-alone atmospheric simulations makes it possible to target a change of SST in the coupled model by targeting a change in the global radiative balance in the stand alone atmospheric simulations, which can be obtained in very short simulations (of a few years)."

The option was not retained for CMIP6. The order of magnitude on continents was -0.3 W/m2, yearly average (Wang et al., 2016).

As explained in the introduction, this target was used for present-day equilibrium simulations, done with the historical forcing of the decade 1990-2010, introducing an 0.007 offset of the oceanic albedo in order to compensate for the absence of oceanic heat uptake. At the end, the final tuning of the mean SST was adjusted about 0.4 K colder than observed, as a compromise, in order to keep enough sea ice over the Antarctic in summer, while all the sea ice parameters were already been pushed to their maximum tolerance (maximum value of albedo and thermal conductivity in particular). Whatever its tuning, the model reaches equilibrium for a slightly positive value (~0.7 W/m2) of the global top-of-atmosphere radiative balance, due to non conservation problems in the model.\nIn the limit of our possibilites, the target was a reasonable seasonal cycle of ice extent in both hemispheres and 20,000 km3 for the Arctic sea ice volume in winter.\nNot only the global radiative balance (or global temperature in the coupled model) was used as a target for tuning, but also the individual value of the global absorbed solar radiation and of the global outgoing longwave radiation. Also the decomposition of each of this fluxes in terms of clear sky and radiative effect of clouds were considered.\nThe total rainfall was also looked at. As is often the case in climate models, it is larger than observations. Although it was not used really as a target (knowing the observation errors on this global metrics are not well known), it may have pushed some model choices toward a reduced global rainfall."

            "The atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ6A-LR is based on a finite-difference formulation of the primitive equations of meteorology (Sadourny and Laval, 1984) on a staggered and stretchable longitude-latitude grid (the Z of LMDZ standing for Zoom). Water vapor, liquid and solid water and atmospheric trace species are advected with a monotonic second order finite volume scheme (Van Leer, 1977; Hourdin and Armengaud, 1999). In the vertical, the model uses a classical so-called hybrid  sigma\u2212pressure coordinate. As concerns physics parameterizations, IPSL participated to CMIP5 with two versions : a \"Standard Physics\" version (atmospheric component LMDZ5A used in IPSL-CM5A, Hourdin et al., 2013a) and an \"New Physics\" version (LMDZ5B used in IPSL-CM5B, Hourdin et al., 2013b) based on a full rethinking of the parameterizations of turbulence, convection and clouds on which the 6A version is built. This NP package includes in particular a trubulent sceme based on the prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetik energy that follows Yamada (1983), a mass flux representation of the organized structures of the convective boundary layer called \"Thermal Plume Model\" (Hourdin et al., 2002, Rio et al., 2008, Rio et al., 2010) and a parameterization of the cold pools or wakes created below cumulonimbus by the evaporation of convective rainfall (Grandpeix et al., 2010ab). The \u201depisodic mixing and buoyancy sorting\u201d scheme originally developed by Emanuel (1991) used for deep convection was modified to make the closure and triggering rely on the description of the subcloud vertical motions by thermal plumes and wakes (Rio et al, 2009). Concerning convection, two important improvement were made from version 5B to 6A : a modification of the lateral detrainment in the thermal plume model that allows to represent satisfacory well the transition from stratocumulus to cumulus clouds (Jam et al., submitted to James) and the introduction of a statitical triggering for deep convection (Rochetin et al., 2014). The radiation scheme is inherited from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and includes in the 6A version the RRTM code for thermal infra-red radiation and 6 bands in the solar radiation. Cloud cover and cloud water content are computed using a statistical scheme using a log normal function for deep convection  (Bony and Emanuel, 2001) and bigaussian for shallow cumulus (Jam et al., 2013). With 79 vertical layers, the 6A version extends to the stratosphere and includes representation of gravity waves generated by mountains as well as by convection (Lott and Guez, 2013) and fronts (de la C\u00e1mara and Lott 2015, de la C\u00e1mara et al., 2016). The 6A-LR version is based on a regular horizontal grid with 144 points regularly spaced in longitude and 142 in latitude, corresponding to a resolution of 2.5\u00b0 \u00d71.3\u00b0."

Specific parameterizations were introduced for the representation of the organized structures of the convective boundary layer, the so-called \"thermal plume model\" (Hourdin et al., 2002, Rio et al., 2008, Rio et al., 2010), and for the cold pools created below cumulonimbus by reevaporation of convective rainfall (Grandpeix et al., 2010ab). Above that, the triggering and closure of the deep convection scheme is controlled in this NP version by subgrid scale vertical velocities associated with boundary layer convective plumes, and air rising downwind of the cold pools gust front. A bi-Gaussian PDF for the subgrid scale water was also coupled to the thermal plume model to better represent cumulus clouds. One important aspect of those developments was to promote an object oriented framework for the parameterization of convection. While many authors advocate for the development of unified parameterizations for convection, the deliberate choice was made to identify as separate objects boundary layer convection (unified between dry and cloudy), cumulonimbus and cold pools, and to develop explicit parameterizations that control their interplay.\nThis approach favors the possibility for different regimes to coexist within the same model column. A first NP version was used in the LMDZ5B versions delivered for CMIP5. Compared to this 5B versions, the main modifications in the 6A version concern the introduction of a stochastic triggering designed to make the frequency of occurrence of new convective systems within a mesh aware of the grid cell size(scale awareness, Rochetin et al., 2014a, Rochetin et al., 2014b), a modification of the thermal plume model for the representation of stratocumulus clouds (Jam et al., in revision)"

            "ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms) is a land-surface model that simulates the energy and water cycles of soil and vegetation, the terrestrial carbon cycle, and the vegetation composition and distribution (Krinner et al, 2005). The land surface is described as a mosaic of twelve plant functional types (PFTs) and bare soil. The definition of PFT is based on ecological parameters such as plant physiognomy (tree or grass), leaves (needle-leaf or broad-leaf), phenology (evergreen, summergreen or raingreen) and photosynthesis pathways for crops and grasses (C3 or C4). Relevant biophysical and biogeochemical parameters are prescribed for each PFT.\nExchanges of energy (latent, sensible, and kinetic energy) and water, between the atmosphere and the biosphere are based on the work of Ducoudr\u00e9 et al (1993); de Rosnay and Polcher (1998) and calculated at a 30min time step together with the exchange of carbon during photosynthesis. The soil water budget within the standard version of ORCHIDEE is done with a 2-layers bucket model (de Rosnay and Polcher, 1998). The water that is not infiltrated or drained at the bottom of the soil is transported through rivers and aquifers (d\u2019Orgeval et al, 2008). This routing scheme allows re-evaporation of the water on its way to the ocean through floodplains or irrigation (de Rosnay et al, 2003).\nThe exchanges of water and energy at the land surface are interlinked with the exchange of carbon. The vegetation state (ie foliage density, interception capacity, soil-water stresses) is computed dynamically within ORCHIDEE (Krinner et al, 2005) and accounts for carbon assimilation, carbon allocation and senescence processes. Carbon exchange at the leaf level during photosynthesis is based on Farquhar et al (1980) and Collatz et al (1992) for C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, respectively. Concomitant water exchange through transpiration is linked to photosynthesis via the stomatal conductance, following the formulation of Ball et al (1987). Photosynthesis is calculated at a 30min time step while carbon allocation in the different soil-plant reservoirs is performed at a daily time step."

The configuration is ORCA2 (Madec and Imbard, 1996) which is a tri-polar global grid and its associated physics. South of 40\u00b0N, the grid is an isotropic Mercator with a nominal resolution of 2\u00b0. A latitudinal grid refinement of 1/2\u00b0 is used in the tropics. North of 40\u00b0N, the grid is no more Mercator and quasi-isotropic, the North Pole singularity being mapped onto a line between points in Canada and Siberia. In the vertical, 31 depth levels are used (from 10m thick near the surface to 500m thick at 5000m)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nNEMOv3.2 uses a partial step formulation (Barnier et al, 2006), which ensures a better representation of bottom bathymetry and thus stream flow and friction at the bottom of the ocean. Advection of temperature and salinity is done using a total variance dissipation scheme (L\u00e9vy et al, 2001; Cravatte et al, 2007). In the momentum equation, an energy and enstrophy conserving scheme is used (Arakawa and Lamb, 1981; Le Sommer et al, 2009). The mixed layer dynamics is parameterized using the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) closure scheme of Blanke and Delecluse (1993) improved by Madec (2008). The improvements include a double diffusion process (Merryfield et al, 1999), Langmuir cells (Axell, 2002) and the contribution of surface wave breaking (Mellor and Blumberg, 2004; Burchard and Rennau, 2008). A parametrization of bottom intensified tidal-driven mixing similar to Simmons et al (2004) is used in combination with a specific tidal mixing parametrization in the Indonesian area (Koch-Larrouy et al, 2007, 2010). NEMOv3.2 also includes prognostic interaction between incoming shortwave radiation into the ocean and the phytoplankton (Lengaigne et al, 2009)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient (ahm) value is 4.104 m2.s\u22121 and the lateral eddy diffusivity coefficient (aht) value is 103 m2.s\u22121. ahm reduces to aht in the tropics, except along western boundaries. The tracer diffusion is along isoneutral surfaces. A Gent and Mcwilliams (1990) term is applied in the advective formulation. Its coefficient is calculated from the local growth rate of baroclinic instability. It decreases in the 20\u25e6S-20\u25e6N band, and vanishes at the Equator. At the ocean floor, there is a linear bottom friction with a coefficient of 4.10\u22124, and a background bottom turbulent kinetic energy of 2.5 10\u22123 m2.s\u22122. The model has a Beckmann and D\u00f6scher (1997) diffusive bottom boundary layer scheme with a value of 104 m2.s\u22121. A spatially varying geothermal flux is applied at the bottom of the ocean (Emile-Geay and Madec, 2009), with a global mean value of 86.4 mW.m\u22122."

The carbon chemistry of the model is based on the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) protocol and the parametrization proposed by Wanninkhof (2014) is used to compute air-sea gas exchange of CO2 and O2. PISCES includes a simple representation of the marine ecosystem with two phytoplankton size classes, representing nanophytoplankton and diatoms, as well as two zooplankton size classes, representing microzooplankton and mesozooplankton. Phytoplankton growth is limited by the availability of nutrients, temperature, and light. There are three non-living components of organic carbon in the model: semi-labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with a lifetime of several weeks to years, as well as large and small detrital particles, which are fuelled by mortality, aggregation, fecal pellet production and grazing. Biogenic silica and calcite particles are also included\nNutrients and/or carbon are supplied to the ocean from three different sources: atmospheric deposition, rivers and sediment mobilization. These sources are explicitly included and vary in time apart the iron input of sediment. Atmospheric deposition of Fe, P and Si has been estimated from the INCA model and the one of N is coming from the Input4MIPS database. River discharge of carbon and nutrients is taken from GlobalNews. Iron input from sediment mobilization has been parameterized as in Aumont and Bopp (2006). \nPISCES is used here not only to compute air-sea fluxes of carbon, but also to compute the effect of a biophysical coupling: the chlorophyll concentration produced by the biological component retroacts on the ocean heat budget by modulating the absorption of light as well as the oceanic heating rate (see Lengaigne et al (2007) for a detailed description).\nNutrients and/or carbon are supplied to the ocean from three different sources: atmospheric deposition, rivers and sediment mobilization.

During the assemblage and tuning of the coupled model, tuning of the atmosphere was applied first to minimize the distance to observed SST from 50S to 50N. This left positive winter air temperature biases in particular in the Northern Hemisphere. The albedo and the thermal conductivity of snow were then tuned online. The target were: the observed seasonal cycle of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extents, and an annual mean Arctic sea ice volume of 20,000 km3. We did not control the Southern Ocean ice volume. The tuning was approximate in that there was no strictly applied criterion, but only a visual verification."

In the first model tuning step, climatology, seasonal progression, and internal climate variability in the tropical coupled system are tuned in order that departures from observations or reanalysis datasets are reduced. Representation of the tropical system in MIROC-ES2H is sensitive to the parameters for cumulus convection and planetary boundary layer processes. Next, the wintertime mid-latitude westerly jets and the stationary waves in the troposphere are tuned using the parameters of the orographic gravity wave drag and the hyper diffusion of momentum. The parameters of the hyper diffusion and the non-orographic gravity wave drag are also used when tuning stratospheric circulations of the polar vortex and QBO. Finally, the radiation budget at the TOA is tuned, primarily using the parameters for the auto-conversion process. The surface albedos for bare sea-ice and snow-covered sea-ice are set to higher values than in observations in order to avoid underestimating of the summertime sea-ice extent in the Arctic Ocean due to excess downward shortwave radiation in this region. In addition, parameter tuning for cooling effects due to interactions between anthropogenic aerosol emissions and cloud-radiative processes are done.

Specifically, parameters of reference height for cumulus precipitation, efficiency of the cumulus entrainment of surrounding environment and maximum cumulus updraft velocity at the cumulus base are used to tune strength of the equatorial trade wind, climatological position and intensity of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and South Pacific Convergence Zone, and interannual variability of El-Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation. Summertime precipitation in the western tropical Pacific and characteristic of tropical intraseasonal oscillations are tuned by using the parameter for shallow convection describing the partitioning of turbulent kinetic energy between horizontal and vertical motions at the sub-cloud layer inversion. Next, the wintertime mid-latitude westerly jets and the stationary waves in the troposphere are tuned using the parameters of the orographic gravity wave drag and the hyper diffusion of momentum. The parameters of the hyper diffusion and the non-orographic gravity wave drag are also used when tuning stratospheric circulations of the polar vortex and Quasi Biennial Oscilation. Finally, the radiation budget at the TOA is tuned, primarily using the parameters for the auto-conversion process so that excess downward radiation can be minimized and maintained closer to 0.0 Wm-2. In addition, parameter tuning for the total radiative forcing associated with aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions is done. In order that the total radiative forcing can be closer to the estimate of -0.9 Wm-2 (IPCC, 2013; negative value indicates cooling), parameters of cloud microphysics and the aerosol transport module, such as timescale for cloud droplet nucleation, in-cloud properties of aerosol removal by precipitation, and minimum threshold of number concentration of cloud droplets, are perturbed. To determine a suitable parameter set, several pairs of a present-day run under the anthropogenic aerosol emissions at the year 2000 and a pre-industrial run are conducted. A pair of the present and preindustrial runs has exactly the same parameters, and differences of tropospheric radiations between two runs are considered as anthropogenic radiative forcing."

The atmospheric model is based on the CCSR-NIES atmospheric general circulation model. The horizontal resolution is a T85 spectral truncation that is an approximately 1.4\u00b0 grid interval for both latitude and longitude. The vertical grid coordinate is a hybrid \u03c3-p coordinate. The model top is placed at 0.004 hPa, and there are 81 vertical levels. The Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) is used as an aerosol module for MIROC6 to predict the mass mixing ratios of the main tropospheric aerosols. By coupling the radiation and cloud-precipitation schemes, SPRINTARS calculates not only the aerosol transport processes but also the aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions.The land surface model is based on Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO), which includes a river routing model based on a kinematic wave flow equation and a lake module where one-dimensional thermal diffusion and mass conservation are considered. The horizontal resolution of the land surface model is the same as that of the atmopheric component. There are a three-layers snow and a six-layers soil down to a 14 m depth.The sea ice-ocean model is based on the CCSR Ocean Component model (COCO). The tripolar horizontal coordinate system is adopted, and the longitudinal grid spacing is 1\u00b0 and the meridional grid spacing varies from about 0.5\u00b0 near the equator to 1\u00b0 in the mid-latitudes. There are 62 vertical levels in a hybrid \u03c3-z coordinate system. A coupler system calculates heat and freshwater fluxes between the sub-models in order to ensure that all fluxes are conserved within machine precision and then exchanges the fluxes among the sub-models. No flux adjustments are used in MIROC6."

In the first model tuning step, climatology, seasonal progression, and internal climate variability in the tropical coupled system are tuned in order that departures from observations or reanalysis datasets are reduced. Representation of the tropical system in MIROC6 is sensitive to the parameters for cumulus convection and planetary boundary layer processes. Next, the wintertime mid-latitude westerly jets and the stationary waves in the troposphere are tuned using the parameters of the orographic gravity wave drag and the hyper diffusion of momentum. The parameters of the hyper diffusion and the non-orographic gravity wave drag are also used when tuning stratospheric circulations of the polar vortex and QBO. Finally, the radiation budget at the TOA is tuned, primarily using the parameters for the auto-conversion process. The surface albedos for bare sea-ice and snow-covered sea-ice are set to higher values than in observations in order to avoid underestimating of the summertime sea-ice extent in the Arctic Ocean due to excess downward shortwave radiation in this region. In addition, parameter tuning for cooling effects due to interactions between anthropogenic aerosol emissions and cloud-radiative processes are done. In order that the cooling effects can be closer to the estimate of -0.9 W/m^2 (IPCC, 2013; negative value indicates cooling) with an uncertainty range of -1.9 to -0.1 W/m^2, parameters of cloud microphysics and the aerosol transport module are perturbed."

In the tuning of the atmospheric model, we adjusted a combination of parameters so that errors in the annual mean top of atmosphere (TOA) radiation distribution become sufficiently small in 5-year test runs with present-day sea-surface conditions. The tuning parameters include precipitation conversion rate (\u2018rcn_akdz_rate\u2019, \u2018rcn_ no_prec_height\u2019) and maximum turbulent entrainment\u2013 detrainment rate (\u2018rcn_entdet_rate_2\u2019) in the cumulus convection scheme, mode radius (\u2018rm_seasalt_bin1\u2019) and a number concentration tuning factor (\u2018fac_nssalt_ finer\u2019) of fine-mode sea-salt aerosol, threshold param- eters for diagnosing stratocumulus clouds (\u2018eisthrs\u2019, \u2018critctei\u2019), and a parameter for ice crystals to snow conversion (\u2018raggregat\u2019). In doing the atmospheric tuning, it was sometimes necessary to examine climate sensitivity to ensure that the climate sensitivity did not fall below that of MRI-CGCM3, in which the 20th century temperature rise was underestimated. This means that we weakly constrained the model\u2019s temperature rise in the 20th century. We experienced that \u2018rcn_entdet_rate_2\u2019 has a moderate sensitivity to the climate sensitivity. As reported in Golaz et al. (2013), we found that the aerosol\u2019s forcing in our model also greatly changes in response to the effective radius threshold for cloud- precipitation conversion. However, we did not change the threshold.\nIn the tuning after coupling, we slightly modified \u2018critctei\u2019 and \u2018fac_nssalt_finer\u2019, which are insensitive to the climate sensitivity and the aerosol\u2019s radiative forcing, for tuning the global-mean TOA net radiation and reducing model drift under preindustrial conditions. In a preliminary historical experiment, the model simulated too large a variability in the equatorial Pacific. Since reducing \u2018rcn_entdet_rate_2\u2019 was found to have an effect to suppress the variability, we se- lected a slightly lower value for the parameter (that slightly increases the climate sensitivity) and re-tuned for the preindustrial spin-up by adjusting \u2018critctei\u2019 and \u2018fac_nssalt_finer\u2019."

It is developed in the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) of Japan Meteorological Agency and used for the aerosol forecasting and climate researches. Log-normal size distributions are assumed for sulfates, BC, and OA, and size-bin method is used for the sea salt and mineral dust. Precursor gases of sulfates include dimethyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide, and oxidized to sulfates via gas- and aqueous-phase reactions. Oxidants of sulfur reactions include OH, NO2, O3, and provided by the chemistry model MRI-CCM2. BC and OA are separated into hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles and their conversion rate is calculated based on the abundance of sulfates. Aerosol concentrations are passed to the atmospheric model MRI-AGCM and aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions are calculated in the atmospheric model. Deposition fluxes of the light absorbing aerosols (BC and mineral dust) are also passed to the atmospheric model and used for the calculation of snow darkening effect of snow and sea ice."

Ten peroxy radicals among the short-lived species are integrated in time by the Euler Backward Iterative (EBI) method of Hertel et al. (1993), while the other short-lived species are diagnosed at each time step by using the two methods: a reduced Jacobian method (Sandilands and McConnel, 1997) for members of the chemical families; and a chemical equilibrium (i.e. steady state) method for H, OH, HO2, N and EO.\n\nThe atmoschem model considers two wet deposition processes (rain-out and wash-out). The rain-out is applied for moderately and highly soluble species, while wash-out is used for highly soluble gases. The two wet deposition processes are represented as a first-order loss process by Giorgi and Chameides (1985).

MRI.COM is a free surface, depth-coordinate ice-ocean coupled model based on the primitive equations under the hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations. It is formulated on generalized orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and its horizontal grid arrangement is Arakawa's B-grid. Note that coast lines are defined by the periphery of the grid cell centered by the velocity point. The ocean component model of MRI-ESM2.0 adopts Murray's (1996) tripolar grid in horizontal and z* coordinate of Adcroft and Campin (2004) in vertical."

It is the latest in a series of global atmosphere models whose development is guided by the Atmosphere Model Working Group (AMWG) of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) project. \n\nCAM6 contains substantial modifications of every atmospheric physics parameterization except for radiative transfer. The Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB) scheme has replaced earlier schemes for boundary layer turbulence, shallow convection and cloud macrophysics. CLUBB is a prognostic moist turbulence scheme that calculates joint higher-order moments of subgrid vertical velocity, water content and liquid water potential temperature. Equations for these moments are closed using assumed joint binormal probability density functions (PDFs) for these quantities. In addition to calculating subgrid vertical fluxes, CLUBB\u2019s PDF closure is also used to calculate large-scale condensation and cloud fraction. An improved two-moment prognostic cloud microphysics (MG2) has also been introduced. The major innovation in MG2 is to carry prognostic precipitation species \u2013 rain and snow \u2013 in addition to cloud condensates. MG2 interacts with the MAM4 aerosol microphysics scheme to calculate condensate mass fractions and number concentrations. Deep convection has been significantly retuned to increase the sensitivity to convective inhibition. Both schemes to calculate subgrid orographic drag have been substantially modified. Topographic orientation (ridges) and low-level flow blocking effects have been incorporated into the orographic gravity wave scheme. The previous parameterization of boundary layer form drag \u2013 turbulent mountain stress (TMS) \u2013 has been replaced with the scheme of Beljaars et al. currently used in the European Center forecast model. In addition to these physics updates, new infrastructure for traceable generation of topographic forcing files has been developed.\n"

Specifically, the model allocates the nitrogen by maximizing the daily net photosynthetic carbon gain under following two key assumptions: nitrogen allocated for light capture, electron transport and carboxylation are co-limiting; respiratory nitrogen is allocated to maintain dark respiration determined by Vcmax.  Temperature acclimation of photosynthesis is also accounted for.\nA full description of photosynthesis and photosynthetic capacity is available in the CLM5 Tech Description (https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Photosynthesis/CLM50_Tech_Note_Photosynthesis.html, https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Photosynthetic_Capacity/CLM50_Tech_Note_Photosynthetic_Capacity.html)   "

Each grid cell can have a different number of land units, each land unit can have a different number of columns, and each column can have multiple PFTs. The first subgrid level, the land unit, is intended to capture the broadest spatial patterns of subgrid heterogeneity. The current land units are glacier, lake, urban, vegetated, and crop (when the crop model option is turned on). The land unit level can be used to further delineate these patterns. For example, the urban land unit is divided into density classes representing the tall building district, high density, and medium density urban areas.  The second subgrid level, the column, is intended to capture potential variability in the soil and snow state variables within a single land unit. For example, the vegetated land unit could contain several columns with independently evolving vertical profiles of soil water and temperature. Similarly, the managed vegetation land unit can be divided into two columns, irrigated and non-irrigated.  The central characteristic of the column subgrid level is that this is where the state variables for water and energy in the soil and snow are defined, as well as the fluxes of these components within the soil and snow. Regardless of the number and type of PFTs occupying space on the column, the column physics operates with a single set of upper boundary fluxes, as well as a single set of transpiration fluxes from multiple soil levels. These boundary fluxes are weighted averages over all PFTs. Currently, for lake and vegetated land units, a single column is assigned to each land unit. The crop land unit is split into irrigated and unirrigated columns with a single crop occupying each column. The urban land units have five columns (roof, sunlit walls and shaded walls, and pervious and impervious canyon floor). The glacier land unit is separated into up to 10 elevation classes. The land/sea mask is defined by the CESM ocean model.  Except for glacier land units, each land grid cell has just one elevation, which is defined by the atmosphere model."

MOSART assumes that all the tributaries within a spatial unit can be treated as a single hypothetical sub-network channel with a transport capacity equivalent to all the tributaries combined. Correspondingly, three routing processes are represented in MOSART: 1) hillslope routing: in each spatial unit, surface runoff is routed as overland flow into the sub-network channel, while subsurface runoff generated in the spatial unit directly enters the sub-network channel; 2) sub-network channel routing: the sub-network channel receives water from the hillslopes, routes water through the channel and discharges it into the main channel; 3) main channel routing: the main channel receives water from the sub-network channel and/or inflow, if any, from the upstream spatial units, and discharges the water to its downstream spatial unit or the ocean.  In MOSART, the travel velocities of water across hillslopes, sub-network and main channel are all estimated using Manning\u2019s equation. https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/MOSART/CLM50_Tech_Note_MOSART.html"

First, recognizing that leaf nitrogen content is dynamic, implementation of  \u201cFlexCN\u201d functionality affords flexible plant stoichiometry and thus a single realized GPP calculation (as opposed to separate potential and actual fluxes). Second, recognizing that foliar photosynthetic capacity responds to environmental conditions and changes over space and time, the Leaf Utilization of Nitrogen for Assimilation (LUNA) module provides a prognostic optimization of maximum leaf-level carboxylation and electron transport rates.  Third, recognizing that changes in nitrogen supply or demand have consequences for plant productivity, the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) module calculates the carbon costs of various nitrogen acquisition strategies and adjusts carbon expenditure on N uptake among biological fixation, active uptake, and retranslocation. Note, as currently implemented the plant C costs calculated by FUN only serve as an additional source of autotrophic respiration, not as an actual belowground C flux to roots or mycorrhizae that interacts with the soil biogeochemistry simulated in CLM5. Collectively, FlexCN, LUNA, and FUN more mechanistically represent plant nitrogen dynamics in CLM5 and afford opportunities to understand, refine, and improve simulated C-N biogeochemical dynamics.   Competition between plant and microbial nitrogen demand can be resolved. Mineral nitrogen in the soil pool at the beginning of the timestep is considered the available supply. The theoretical maximum demand for nitrogen by plants to meet the entire carbon uptake given an N cost of zero (and therefore represents the upper bound on N requirements). N uptake costs that are > 0 imply that the plant will take up less N that it demands, ultimately.  However, given the heuristic nature of the N competition algorithm, this discrepancy is not explicitly resolved here.  Soil carbon decomposition rates can be limited by the availability of  mineral nitrogen, but calculation of this limitation depends on first estimating the potential rates of decomposition, assuming an unlimited  mineral nitrogen supply.  Asymbiotic (or free living) N fixation is a function of evapotranspiration and is added to the inorganic nitrogen (NH4+) pool. Symbiotic N fixation is handled by the FUN model and is passed straight to the plant, not the mineral nitrogen pool.  Fertilizer is added to crops during the emergence phase.

In CISM computations of ice sheet velocity, thickness, and temperature, all ice-covered grid cells are treated identically, whether or not they are connected to the main ice sheet.  See Section 4 for details.\n\nCLM, as noted in 3.1.1.2, has a glacier surface type.  Glaciated grid cells can lie either within or outside an ice sheet.  The following statements apply to glacier columns outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets:\n- Glaciated grid cells contain a single elevation class (unlike glaciated grid cells in Greenland and Antarctica, which contain multiple elevation classes to support more accurate SMB downscaling).\n- If the snow in a glacier column completely melts, then the underlying ice can melt.  Meltwater from underlying ice remain in place until it refreezes, possible staying in place indefinitely in a warm climate.  Thus, ice melt does not result in any runoff.  (For Greenland and Antarctica, melted ice runs off to the ocean.)\n- The snow thickness is capped at a maximum of 10 m liquid water equivalent.  Any additional snow accumulation is routed to the ocean as liquid runoff, generating a negative sensible heat flux.  This matches the behavior of non-glacier columns with deep seasonal snow, and avoids unrealistic ocean cooling in regions that have little solid runoff in reality.  (For Greenland and Antarctica, snow is also capped at 10 m, but additional accumulation is routed to the ocean as solid runoff, to crudely simulation iceberg calving.)\n\nApart from these differences in elevation classes and the treatment of solid and liquid runoff, CLM\u2019s glacier treatment is independent of geographic region (i.e., whether a grid cell lies inside or outside an ice sheet).  Glacier physics is described in detail in the \u201cGlaciers\u201d chapter of the CLM Technical Note (https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs)."

            "CISM's parallel, higher-order dynamical core, known as Glissade, solves equations for conservation of momentum (i.e., an appropriate approximation of Stokes flow), mass, and internal energy.  The equations are discretized on a structured 3D grid.  In the map plane, the grid consists of rectangular cells, each with four vertices.  The vertical levels of the grid are based on a terrain-following sigma coordinate system.  Scalars such as ice thickness and temperature are located at cell centers, and the horizontal velocity components are computed at vertices.  \n\nFor CMIP6 simulations, CISM uses a depth-integrated viscosity approximation (DIVA), which is based on Goldberg (2011) and is part of the L1L2 family of approximations.  DIVA can be derived from the 3D Blatter-Pattyn approximation by replacing horizontal velocity gradients in the effective strain rate with their vertical averages.  Then the equations of motion can be integrated in z, yielding a 2D elliptic system of equations for the vertical-mean velocity components (u_mean,v_mean).  This 2D system (eq. 25 of Lipscomb et al. 2019) is formally equivalent to the shallow-shelf approximation, except that the basal boundary terms are modified to incorporate vertical shear.   The elliptic system is assembled and solved using finite-element methods.  After computing u_mean and v_mean at each vertex, it is straightforward to evaluate the 3D velocity components u(z) and v(z).\n\nHorizontal transport of mass and tracers is described by equations of the form of (58) and (59) in Lipscomb et al. (2019).  These equations are solved using an incremental remapping method, which is a kind of finite-volume scheme.  This scheme is conservative, non-oscillatory, and formally second-order accurate, except where reduced locally to first-order to preserve monotonicity.  After horizontal transport, there is a vertical remapping step to restore tracers to the vertical sigma coordinate.\n\nConservation of internal energy is divided into an advective component (linked to the mass transport scheme) and a diffusive/dissipative component (eq. 38 of Lipscomb et al. 2019).  Temperature evolution is computed by solving an implicit tridiagonal equation with suitable boundary conditions in each column.\n\nFor the velocity solver, Glissade assumes a basal friction law of the form tau_b = beta * u_b, where tau_b is basal shear stress, u_b is basal velocity, and beta is a friction parameter.  For CMIP6 simulations, CISM relates basal shear stress to velocity using a pseudo-plastic basal sliding law (eq. 67 in Lipscomb et al. 2019) as described by Aschwanden et al. (2013).  The basal yield stress is proportional to effective pressure, which is a function of basal water depth (eq. 70 of Lipscomb et al. 2019) following Bueler and van Pelt (2015).\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. of Lipscomb et al. (2019) give a detailed description of Glissade\u2019s velocity, temperature, and transport solvers, respectively.  Section 3.4 describes basal sliding.\n\nNo ice shelves are included in CISM Greenland simulations for CMIP6.\n"

Separate fluxes are computed for each of 10 glacier elevation classes in each grid cell. The coupler computes annual averages of this flux, then downscales it to the CISM grid, using both horizontal and vertical interpolation. CLM\u2019s SMB only considers changes in the ice column, not changes in the snow pack. A positive SMB (ice accumulation) is generated when the snow pack grows beyond its prescribed limit (snow capping). A negative SMB is generated when CLM's ice column experiences melt.

For CMIP6, an interactive Antarctic ice sheet is not supported.  Most CMIP6 simulations are run without an interactive ice sheet.\n\nIn non-interactive simulations, the ice sheet does not evolve, but CLM still computes ice sheet SMB.  The SMB is computed for the glaciated fraction of CLM grid cells in multiple elevation classes (aka \u201cglacier columns\u201d) in Greenland and Antarctica (see section 4.2.1.1).  (CLM also computes and sends the temperature of the top ice layer.  When we refer to SMB calculations, it is understood that this temperature is included as well.)  For Greenland, the SMB in each glacier column is passed from CLM to CISM via the coupler and is downscaled to the CISM grid.  For Antarctica, CLM also computes an SMB in glacier columns, but there is no Antarctic grid for downscaling.  For glaciers and ice caps outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, CLM computes the SMB in a single glacier column per gridcell.  Thus, in CESM runs without an interactive ice sheet, CISM\u2019s main role is to serve as a downscaling target for Greenland SMB.\n\nFor coupled climate \u2013 ice sheet experiments (e.g., the \u201cwithism\u201d simulations for ISMIP6), CESM2 is run with an interactive Greenland ice sheet. In this case the SMB is computed by CLM in multiple glacier columns, is downscaled to the CISM grid, and serves as an upper boundary condition for an active ice sheet.  CISM solves equations for ice sheet velocity and the evolution of ice thickness and temperature over a coupling interval.  (See section 4 for details.)  CISM then sends the new ice sheet extent and thickness to CLM via the coupler.  In CLM the fractional area and elevation in each glacier column are modified accordingly, with adjustments for conservation of water and energy.  In this way the SMB and ice sheet dynamics evolve consistently.\n\nWhen referring below to the \u201cland ice model\u201d, we will try to make clear whether we are referring to CISM, or the SMB component in CLM, or the combination.\n"

The base value for dry snow (rsnw_nonmelt) is 500 microns, and a predefined standard deviation (rsnw_std) of 250 microns from observations is used for tuning in the following: rsnw = rsnw_nonmelt - r_snw*rsnw_std, where r_snw is adjusted for tuning and by default in our simulations is 1.25. Hence, the starting dry snow grain radius is 500-1.25*250 = 187.5 microns. Once melting starts (determined by dt_mlt), the snow grain radius grows linearly until it achieves a maximum snow grain radius at 0C. Currently, melting begins at dt_mlt = -1.5C and the maximum snow grain radius (rsnw_mlt) is 1500 microns. Tuning of the r_snw value and also sometimes dt_mlt and the maximum snow grain radius value is used to adjust the surface albedo. This is typically done to reach a reasonable sea ice thickness and summer snow cover in pre-industrial control simulations, where \"reasonable\" is based on expert judgement. "

This simplification reduces the number of tracers by a factor of 3, which allows maintaining sustainable throughput at high spatial resolution. Chemical production of sulfate is from oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the gas phase by OH, and in the aqueous phase by O3 and H2O2. The rate of aqueous-phase oxidation of sulfate by O3 and H2O2 depends on the solution pH (Seinfeld & Pandis, 1998). There is no explicit treatment of ozone chemistry. Instead, the monthly concentrations of O3 and other oxidants (OH, HO2 , and NO3 ) and the photolysis rate of H2O2 used by the sulfate chemistry are extracted and averaged over a 20 year climatology (1981\u20132000) simulated with AM3 (Naik et al., 2013). Fixed diurnal variations are imposed to the radicals with maximum during daytime for OH, HO2, jH2O2 and nightime for NO3. A step function is used for HO2 and NO3, and a sinusoidal variation with maximum at noon for OH and jH2O2."

The soil tile is further subdivied into different land use types such as croplands, pastures, primary and secondary lands (i.e. recovering after logging or agricultural abandonment). The fraction of each land-use tile changes annually according to historical reconstructions or future scenarios of land use from CMIP6 forcing. Soil water runoff is transported to the ocean by a grid-scale river and lake network. Prognostic variables for soil, lake, and overlaying constant-density snowpack are liquid content, ice content, and temperature (all vertically distributed). The soil is treated as a dual-domain (Beven & Germann, 1982), saturated-unsaturated, soil-bedrock continuum, in which matrix flow is governed by Richard\u2019s equation (Hillel, 1980), and both infiltration and parameterized subgrid discharge to rivers may be facilitated by idealized macropores. Lakes are represented by one or more vertical columns, with density-driven stratification and overturning. Prognostic variables for each river reach are depth-averaged liquid mass, solid mass, and sensible heat content. Rivers flow according to the hydraulic geometry of Leopold and Maddock (1953). Prognostic variables for vegetation are mass of carbon in each of five plant compartments (leaves, fine roots, heartwood, sapwood, and labile), and liquid and solid water storage and temperature on leaves. Vegetation type (C3 or C4 grass, temperate deciduous, tropical, or cold evergreen tree) is determined by plant total carbon and climate (Shevliakova et al., 2009). Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are determined mechanistically (Leuning, 1995). "

UNICON successfully simulates various transitional phenomena associated with convection (e.g., the diurnal cycle of precipitation and the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation) without degrading the mean climate (Park 2014b). This improvement is mainly due to the explicit parameterization of complex interactions among convective updrafts, convective downdrafts, and mesoscale organized flow driven by subgrid cold pools, and associated simulation of convective plume memory across the time step, which cannot be simulated by CAM5\u2019s shallow and deep convection schemes (Park 2014a). The revised cloud macrophysics scheme diagnoses additional detrained cumulus that are not overlapped horizontally with cumulus and stratus clouds in each grid layer, by assuming a steady state balance between the detrainment rate of cumulus condensates and the dissipation rate of detrained condensates by entrainment mixing. The addition of detrained cumulus substantially improves the simulation of low-level clouds and the associated shortwave cloud radiative forcing, particularly in the subtropical trade cumulus regime (Park et al. 2017).\nRefer to Park et al.
