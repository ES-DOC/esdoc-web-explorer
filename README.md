## Package management overview

Either the `yarn` or the `npm` package managers can be used to build and test the
application. `yarn` is preferred since it is more secure, but for now, until older
dependencies have been updated across the stack, only `npm` may work, so both
options are documented below.


### Project setup with `yarn` (use this if possible)

#### Project setup
```
yarn install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

#### Run your tests
```
yarn run test
```

#### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```


### Project setup with `npm` (only use this if `yarn` can't be used)

As above but using `npm` instead:

#### Project setup
```
npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

#### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

#### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
